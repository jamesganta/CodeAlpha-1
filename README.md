# Overview

Purpose:

This Java program is designed to calculate the overall grade of a single student based on their marks in multiple subjects.
Key Features:

Dynamic Input: The program starts by asking the user to enter the number of subjects for which the student has marks. This allows flexibility for different academic scenarios.

Data Storage:

It utilizes an array (subjectMarks) to efficiently store the marks obtained by the student in each subject.
This array structure makes it easy to process and manipulate the subject-wise marks.
Mark Input and Calculation:

The program iteratively prompts the user to enter the marks for each subject.
It simultaneously calculates the totalMarks by summing the marks of all subjects.
Average Calculation:

The program calculates the averageMarks by dividing the totalMarks by the number of subjects.
Grade Determination:

It implements a grading system.
Based on the calculated averageMarks, the program assigns a letter grade (A+, A, B, C, D, or F) using a series of if-else if-else conditions.
You can customize these conditions to match your specific grading scale.
Result Display:

Finally, the program displays the calculated averageMarks and the assigned grade to the user.
In essence:

This project provides a practical example of how to:

Use arrays to store and process multiple data points (subject marks).
Handle user input and perform basic calculations.
Implement a simple decision-making logic (grading system) using conditional statements.
Present the results in a user-friendly format.
This program can be further enhanced by:

Adding input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numerical values for marks.
Implementing more sophisticated grading systems with more granular grade divisions (e.g., A-, B+, etc.).
Allowing the user to input subject names along with their marks for a more informative output.
